# Assumptions
### Styling (css-in-js)
Since the assessment stated that no css framework should be used. I chose to use styled-components allows ease use of css-in-js approach of working in React


# Issues Faced
- State Managment : I initially used Context API which worked pretty well but the app was very slow so I thought to use apollo-client (bad idea) - testing new waters in a time bound project like this probably not the best option so I ended up having to rewrite the functionalities I had written in Context while learning 

### Things that don't work
- Clicking the cart button doesn't show the cart section: Add to cart on single page or all cart does work fine
- Increasing and decreasing quantity of cart Item

# Feedback
This is a true test I must say. This enabled me to see gaps I need to fill. Even if I don't get this role, I am glad to have done this.
